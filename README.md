Once the city is inputted, the dashboard displays the weather for that current moment including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a matching icon. 

The UV index will change from green, yellow, or red depending on the severity of the index.

## Future Updating & Additions
Adding lists or rows into each hour time block could allow the user to enter in content in a helpful way. This could be an added tool to this application in the future.
